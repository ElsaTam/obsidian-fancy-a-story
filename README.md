FANCY A STORY
=============

**By Kapirklaa**

I started working on this theme because
- I wanted to have fun with CSS
- I wanted a theme that would create an inspiring environment when I'm working on my worldbuilding, TTRPG, investigation projects.

It is still a work in progress. If you're interested in new features, feel free to open an issue to request one.
I am not expecting this theme to be for everyone, it is not the lightest one and can be heavy to look at.

> Still not tested on tablet or mobile

Every panes in the sidebar use a background texture. The coffee stain is only in the file explorer. These backgrounds can be disabled in the Style Settings plugin, in the Accessibility section.

### Different light schemes

The dynamic color palette is created only for the available pre-computed schemes. If you're using custom primary/text colors (for exampl with the Custom theme variant that let you choose this option), the colot palette won't adapt to your choices.
