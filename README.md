FANCY A STORY
=============

**By Kapirklaa**

I started working on this theme because
- I wanted to have fun with CSS
- I wanted a theme that would create an inspiring environment when I'm working on my worldbuilding, TTRPG, investigation projects.

It is still a work in progress. If you're interested in new features, feel free to open an issue to request one.
I am not expecting this theme to be for everyone, it is not the lightest one and can be heavy to look at.

> [!WARNING]
> Still not tested on tablet or mobile

Features
--------

I still need to create a doc because I created several new layouts/effects with Obsidian elements. But here is a quick list for now, in case you want to explore by yourself (and if you have any question about how to use one of the feature, don't heasitate to reach):

- Accessibility option. You can turn it on in the Style Settings and it will disable Serif fonts, make the font a little bit bigger, etc.
- Rainbow folders
- Task list icons
- Multiple new callouts, you can find them as standalones [here](https://github.com/ElsaTam/Obsidian-Stuff/tree/main/snippets/callouts)
- New css classes for your notes
  - `newspaper` ([see here](https://github.com/ElsaTam/Obsidian-Stuff/tree/main/snippets/newspaper))
  - Multi columns (`columns-2`, `columns-3`, `columns-4`)
  - `black-and-white`
  - `wide-page`
  - `confidential` (change the `==highlights==` to black marker hiding text)
- New lists using tags
  - `#family-tree`
  - `#tree-view`
- Invisible embeds with `![[your note|faded]]`

Some screenshots in random order
--------------------------------

### File explorer

Every panes in the sidebar use a background texture. The coffee stain is only in the file explorer. These backgrounds can be disabled in the Style Settings plugin, in the Accessibility section.

### Different light schemes

The dynamic color palette is created only for the available pre-computed schemes. If you're using custom primary/text colors (for exampl with the Custom theme variant that let you choose this option), the colot palette won't adapt to your choices.
