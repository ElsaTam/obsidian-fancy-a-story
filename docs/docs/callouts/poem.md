The callout `poem` centers the content and can be used with a `<cite>...</cite>` HTML tag to cite the author.

It comes in three different variations. If you need to have special text alignment for your poesy, such as for concrete poetry, try the [poem code block]({% link docs/code/poem.md %})

## Default

```markdown
> [!poem] Do not go gentle into that good night,
> Do not go gentle into that good night,
> Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
> ...
>
> <cite>Dylan Thomas</cite>
```

[![]({% link images/callouts/poem.webp %})]({% link images/callouts/poem.webp %})

## Framed

```markdown
> [!poem|frame] Do not go gentle into that good night,
> Do not go gentle into that good night,
> Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
> ...
>
> <cite>Dylan Thomas</cite>
```

[![]({% link images/callouts/poem-frame.webp %})]({% link images/callouts/poem-frame.webp %})

## Floral

```markdown
> [!poem|floral] Do not go gentle into that good night,
> Do not go gentle into that good night,
> Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
> ...
>
> <cite>Dylan Thomas</cite>
